This module centralizes all static text, markdown, and HTML content used
throughout the application.

By separating content from the application logic (in app_pages.py), we make
the app easier to maintain, update, and potentially translate.

Author: AI Engineering SME
Version: 25.1 (Commercial Grade Build)
Date: 2025-07-12

Changelog from v24.1:
- [CRITICAL-CONTENT] Implemented a robust `render_workflow_step` function. This
  function now generates self-contained, modern HTML with inline CSS (Flexbox)
  to create the stable and visually appealing workflow diagram for the enhanced
  "Hybrid Manifesto" page.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Polished all markdown content within the `get_*_expander_content`
  functions to improve readability, using consistent headers and formatting for
  a professional user experience.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Improved the "guidance_data" content with clearer, more
  compelling rationales for each recommended approach.
- [MAINTAINABILITY] The HTML generation in `render_workflow_step` is structured
  within a single f-string, making it easy to modify the layout and styles in one
  place.
- [STYLE] Added type hints to all function signatures for improved code quality
  and static analysis.

# 1. MARKDOWN CONTENT FOR EXPANDERS

# Storing long markdown blocks here keeps the page-rendering scripts clean.

def get_qfd_expander_content() -> str:
    """Returns the markdown content for the QFD expander."""
    return """
**Methodology:**
Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is a structured method for translating customer requirements (the "Voice of the Customer") into design specifications (the "Voice of the Engineer"). The 'House of Quality' matrix is the primary tool used to map customer needs to technical characteristics, creating a traceable and justifiable link.

**Regulatory Significance:**
This creates a **documented, traceable link** between user needs and design inputs, which is a core requirement of **FDA Design Controls (21 CFR 820.30)**. It provides objective evidence for *why* certain technical specifications were prioritized for the **Design History File (DHF)**, demonstrating a systematic approach to design.
"""

def get_kano_expander_content() -> str:
    """Returns the markdown content for the Kano Model expander."""
    return """
**Methodology:**
The Kano model is a framework for categorizing product or service features based on how they impact customer satisfaction. It helps prioritize development efforts by distinguishing between different types of customer needs:
- **Basic (Must-be):** Features that are taken for granted. Their absence causes dissatisfaction, but their presence doesn't increase satisfaction (e.g., a car having brakes). In diagnostics, this could be detecting a well-known, common mutation.
- **Performance:** Features for which "more is better." Satisfaction is proportional to how well they are implemented (e.g., a car's fuel efficiency). In diagnostics, this could be assay sensitivity (lower LoD).
- **Excitement (Delighter):** Unexpected features that create high satisfaction when present, but whose absence does not cause dissatisfaction (e.g., the first time a car had a built-in GPS). In diagnostics, this could be identifying a novel, clinically actionable biomarker.

**Interpretation:**
This model provides a strategic framework to justify which features are critical for the product's intended use and which are secondary. This helps focus Verification & Validation (V&V) efforts on what matters most to the end-user (e.g., the clinician), a key principle of user-centric design that is highly regarded by regulators.
"""

def get_msa_expander_content() -> str:
    """Returns markdown content for the Measurement System Analysis expander."""
    return """
**Methodology:**
A Gage R&R (Repeatability & Reproducibility) study is a designed experiment to quantify the amount of variation in a measurement system itself. It partitions the total observed variance into its components:
- **Part-to-Part Variation:** The true biological variation we want to measure.
- **Repeatability (Equipment Variation):** Variation from repeated measurements by the same operator with the same equipment.
- **Reproducibility (Appraiser Variation):** Variation between different operators using the same equipment.

**Regulatory Significance:**
You cannot trust your process data until you trust your measurement system. Before any process characterization (ICH Q11) or validation (Process Performance Qualification - PPQ), the analytical methods used must themselves be validated. A Gage R&R study provides the standard evidence that the measurement system is reliable and its contribution to total variation is acceptable (typically <10% of total process tolerance, or %-Contribution < 30%). This is a non-negotiable prerequisite for all subsequent stages and a key part of Analytical Validation.
"""

def get_pccp_expander_content() -> str:
    """Returns markdown content for the PCCP expander."""
    return """
**Methodology:**
A **Pre-determined Change Control Plan (PCCP)** is a comprehensive "blueprint" submitted to regulators that prospectively defines how a learning AI/ML model will be monitored, updated, and re-validated after deployment. It includes:
- **Performance Monitoring:** The specific metrics that will be tracked (e.g., AUC, F1-score).
- **Retraining Triggers:** The objective criteria that will trigger a model update (e.g., performance drops below 0.90 AUC for 3 consecutive days).
- **Modification Protocol:** The specific, pre-defined changes that can be made (e.g., re-training on new data, but not changing the model architecture).
- **Re-validation Protocol:** The plan for validating the updated model before it is deployed.

**Regulatory Significance:**
This is a cornerstone of **Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP)** and is essential for any AI/ML-based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) that is expected to learn over time. It demonstrates a controlled, auditable, and safe process for managing a "locked" but updatable algorithm, satisfying the FDA's need for safety and effectiveness while allowing for state-of-the-art model maintenance.
