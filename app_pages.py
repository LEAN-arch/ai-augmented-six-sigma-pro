    2.  **Verify with ANOVA (or Permutation):** For comparing group performance (e.g., from the Pareto chart), ANOVA is the standard first step. If its assumptions are violated (check with a normality test), use a more robust permutation test.
    3.  **Model with Both, Trust the Best:** Fit both a Linear Regression (for a simple baseline) and an ensemble ML model. If the ML model is significantly more accurate (check R¬≤), its feature importance rankings from SHAP are a more reliable guide to the true root causes than the coefficients from a poorly-fitting linear model.
