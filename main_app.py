"""
main_app.py

Serves as the primary entry point and navigation controller for the Bio-AI 
Excellence Framework application.

This script is responsible for:
1.  Initializing global configurations (logging, page settings).
2.  Loading external configurations and secrets.
3.  Dynamically and safely importing page-rendering functions.
4.  Constructing the application's navigation structure using Streamlit's
    modern st.navigation API.
5.  Rendering the main application layout, including the sidebar.
6.  Executing the selected page's rendering logic.

This architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, where this main script
handles the "scaffolding" and "routing," while content and logic are delegated
to dedicated modules.
