"""
main_app.py

Serves as the primary entry point and navigation controller for the Bio-AI
Excellence Framework application.

This script is responsible for:
1.  Initializing global configurations (logging, page settings).
2.  Loading external configurations and secrets with robust fallbacks.
3.  Dynamically and safely importing page-rendering functions.
4.  Constructing the application's navigation structure using Streamlit's
    modern st.navigation API.
5.  Rendering the main application layout, including the sidebar.
6.  Executing the selected page's rendering logic.

Author: AI Engineering SME
Version: 24.1 (SME Refactored Build)
Date: 2024-05-21

Changelog from v23.8:
- [FIX] Moved all module imports to the top level for PEP 8 compliance,
  better dependency clarity, and faster subsequent executions.
- [FIX] Refactored the logging configuration to be more robust. It now checks
  if handlers are already configured to prevent duplicate log outputs in
  re-runs and uses the standard stderr stream for logs.
- [OPTIMIZATION] Centralized configuration loading by fetching `st.secrets`
  once to avoid redundant dictionary lookups.
- [REFACTOR] Improved error handling for missing modules. A single, clear
  try-except block now wraps the main execution, providing a clean exit path
  for fatal import errors.
- [STYLE] Added type hints for function signatures for improved code quality
  and maintainability.
